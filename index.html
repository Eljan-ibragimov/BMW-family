    <div class="about">
        <p>BMW, in full Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, German automaker noted for quality sports sedans and motorcycles.
            Headquarters are in Munich.

            It originated in 1916 as Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke, a builder of aircraft engines, but assumed the name
            Bayerische Motoren Werke in July 1917 and began producing motorcycles in the 1920s. BMW entered the
            automobile business in 1928. The company’s R32 motorcycle set a world speed record that was not broken until
            1937. During World War II BMW built the world’s first jet airplane engines, used by the Luftwaffe, Germany’s
            air force. After the war the company tried to move into the small-car market but found that it could not
            compete effectively against Volkswagen’s compact, inexpensive autos. By 1959 the company was on the verge of
            bankruptcy, and its managers were planning to sell the firm to Daimler-Benz.

            In that year, however, BMW pulled out of its financial slump; German entrepreneur Herbert Quandt acquired a
            controlling interest in the firm, and BMW introduced its 700 series, soon followed by the equally successful
            1500 model. At about the same time, the company introduced a new series of motorcycles that were
            particularly popular in the United States.
